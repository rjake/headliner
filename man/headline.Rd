\arguments{
\item{compare}{a numeric value to compare to a reference value}

\item{reference}{a numeric value to act as a control for the 'compare' value}

\item{headline}{a string to format the final output. Uses
\code{\link[glue]{glue}} syntax}

\item{...}{arguments passed to \code{\link[glue]{glue_data}}}

\item{if_match}{string to display if numbers match, uses
\code{\link[glue]{glue}} syntax}

\item{trend_phrases}{list of values to use for when y is more than x, y is the
same as x, or y is less than x. You can pass it just
\code{\link{trend_terms}} (the default) and call the result with
\code{"...{trend}..."} or pass is a named list (see examples)}

\item{plural_phrases}{named list of values to use when difference (delta) is
singular (delta = 1) or plural (delta != 1)}

\item{orig_values}{a string to display the two original values. Uses
\code{\link[glue]{glue}} syntax. \code{{c}} = the 'compare' value, and
\code{{r}} = 'reference'}

\item{n_decimal}{numeric value to limit the number of decimal places in
the returned values.}

\item{round_all}{logical value to indicate if all values should be rounded.
When FALSE, the values will return with no modification. When TRUE (default)
all values will be round to the length specified by 'n_decimal'.}

\item{multiplier}{number indicating the scaling factor. When multiplier = 1
(default), 0.25 will return 0.25. When multiplier = 100, 0.25 will return 25.}

\item{return_data}{logical to indicate whether function should return the
phrase components used to compose the headline}

\item{x}{a list with values to compare, if named, can call by name}
