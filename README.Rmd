The goal of `headliner` is to translate facts into insights. Given two values, `headliner` generates building blocks for creating dynamic text. These talking points can be combined using using `glue` syntax to add informative titles to plots, section headers or other text in a report.

## Installation

You can install the dev version of `headliner` from [github](https://github.com/rjake/headliner) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("rjake/headliner")
```

Let's look at some of the talking points for the difference between 5 and 7:
```{r}
library(headliner)

compare_values(5, 7) |> # returns a list
  view_list() # show as a data frame
```

We can string these together these talking points like this:

```{r}
headline(
  x = 5, 
  y = 7, 
  headline = "There was {article_delta_p}% {trend} ({orig_values})"
)
```
